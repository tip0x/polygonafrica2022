* navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the DApp. Allow the DApp to access MetaMask.
* Get some Goerli testnet Ethers in your MetaMask wallet. Head over to [Goerli faucet](https://goerli-faucet.slock.it/)
* Add Mumbai Matic network to MetaMask
* Get some test MATIC, posRootERC20, posRootERC721, posRootERC1155, plasmaRootERC20 and plasmaRootERC721 tokens from [Polygon Faucet](https://faucet.polygon.technology/)
* Add posRootERC20, posRootERC721, posRootERC1155, rootChainWETH, plasmaRootERC20, and plasmaRootERC721 to MetaMask under Goerli network
* Add posChildERC20, posChildERC721, posChildERC1155, posChildWETH, plasmaWETH,plasmChildERC20 and plasmaChildERC721  tokens to MetaMask under Mumbai Matic Testnet.
